In this project, I have extracted data of real-time CO2 emissions using an API, cleaned and preprocessed the data, and built various time series models including AR, ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM. The repository also includes the necessary scripts for analyzing the models and selecting the best-performing ones. Finally, the selected model is used for forecasting CO2 emissions for the next 10 years.

In this Project, I developed a COVID-19 UK Cases GUI using Tkinter in Python. It offers real-time data updates, interactive graphs, date selection via a calendar widget, and a convenient place comparison feature. This user-friendly interface provides up-to-date COVID-19 information, interactive visuals, and the ability to focus on specific dates or regions for analysis.

I leveraged SQL to uncover valuable insights for app developers. From the advantages of paid apps and language support optimization to pinpointing lower-rated app categories, Examined the role of app descriptions in user ratings and provided a benchmark for new apps looking to stand out in a competitive market. I addressed the competitive games and entertainment genres, revealing a path to success through unique value and quality.

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.
