In this project, I have extracted data of real-time CO2 emissions using an API, cleaned and preprocessed the data, and built various time series models including AR, ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM. The repository also includes the necessary scripts for analyzing the models and selecting the best-performing ones. Finally, the selected model is used for forecasting CO2 emissions for the next 10 years.
